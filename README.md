# Air_Mouse
We have implemented an optimal and functional air mouse. The work is based on the idea of roll and pitch values of the accelerometer motion in space. We have tested the air mouse and concluded that it can perform various tasks that a typical mouse can do satisfactorily (Motion and clicking) and have optimized it as far as the components involved can. This has made our air mouse a better candidate for replacing a typical mouse. We also focused on improving the user experience by trying to implement usage of ‘toggle’ states and also make the air mouse capable of ‘dragging’ the cursor on the screen.
